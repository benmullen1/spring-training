# Spring Training Repository
These are all training exercises from the Udemy course titled
"Become Java Spring Boot Full Stack Developer. Learn Spring Framework, Spring Boot, Spring Data, Docker & AWS"


## Exercise 1
Related to the content in this repository:

[https://github.com/in28minutes/master-spring-and-spring-boot/tree/main/01-spring/learn-spring-framework-02/src/main/java/com/in28minutes/learnspringframework/examples/c1](https://github.com/in28minutes/master-spring-and-spring-boot/tree/main/01-spring/learn-spring-framework-02/src/main/java/com/in28minutes/learnspringframework/examples/c1)

That repository is the solution from the instructor, unfortunately. There is not a separate 'before' implementation, as far as I can tell.


The actual exercise is to implement a small Spring application with some beans

## Exercise 2
is not really an exercise, but a code-along following the concepts of the next section of the course
it is a spring-boot with rest API and a more elaborated version of the data layer from Exercise 1.
